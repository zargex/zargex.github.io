    "content": "I have been playing with KOReader for some days and so far it is very good.It has a lot of options to customize the experience of using my Kobo, at first itcould be overwhelming but I think it is worth it.Now, I really missed it didn’t have a dictionary included. So let’s see how to add one.How to add a dictionary to KOReader  Find a dictionary in the StarDict format.  Copy the dictionary to .adds/koreader/data/dict/I tried an english dictionary made from Wiktionary1.After I decompress the file, it looks like this:adds/koreader/data/dict/dict-en-en/  res/  dict-data.dict.dz  dict-data.idx  dict-data.ifo  dict-data.syn  As dictionaries can lives in different folders, I can keep adding them. For example, I can add an Spanish dictionary next.Now we can see the dictionary running in KOReader.The dictionary dialogDownload dictionaries in KOReader directlyKOReader has a function to download dictionaries directly in the kobo.These are the steps to do it:  Open the main menu.  Tap the magnifying glass.  Tap Settings, then Dictionary Settings  Tap Download dictionaries  Choose a language  Tap the title of a dictionary you want, then Download.I chose the manual method because I like Wiktionary and it has a huge number of entries.How to export highlights and notesI use to highlight a lot while reading and I’m really glad to find that exporting those it is really easy in KOReader  Open your book.  Open the main menu and tap the wrench and screwdriver icon.  Then tap Exports all notes in this book  Find your notes in .adds/koreader/clipboard/  You can choose different formats like markdown for your notes and change the destination folder.Both options are in the same menu.  You can export highlights into your Calibre using the KOReader Sync plugin. But I did a quick test and the highlights aren’t ordered.            ebook-reader-dict &#8617;      "

    "content": "Since a bought my Kobo Libra H2O, I have been thinking about tinker it a little bit installing acustom firmware and readers. And after a friend of mine convinced me, I finally decided to do it.I am going to install KOReader1 and Plato2. Both are custom readers for Kobo (and other devices) with more features than the original.I understand that KOReader has a lot of options while Plato is more streamline and it is better to read PDFs.Getting the filesIn this link, we find the instructions to install each of the readers (or both at the same time) as well as a little script to make everything easier.  Get the zip, in my case KOReader and Plato  Get the script.  The above links points to an specific version, in case they are broken. Review the forum thread and use the new links.Installing the files  Do a full restart of the kobo, as it is suggested in the forum.  With the Kobo in the home screen (without opening any book), connect the kobo to the computer and mount it.  Run the script and follow the instructions.  Now, eject and unplug the kobo.  My Kobo restarted after I ejected it. Depending of your device, maybe you have to restart it manually.During a the restart, Kobo will install the new readers and other things.ResultNow I see a little new menu call NickelMenu at the botton right corner.That is the menu we are going to use to launch Plato and KOReader.NickeMenuKOReaderThe first thing I saw, was the tutorial. I can navigate throught the files like a normal unix filesystem (the home is /mnt/onboard/) and it shows me folders with the name of the authors.Books in KOReaderI opened The Prince and among the options I found a two columns setting.Using the option of two columnsThis is how the top menu looks like.KOReader top menuReally insteresting, and I just learned that there is a plugin for KOReader to enable SSH!.I will review the other plugins.PlatoOpening Plato for first time it didn’t offer any tutorial or guide, instead, a very intuitive homescreen (really similar to the original one).Books in PlatoI opened again The Prince to see the options. To the right I can tap in the icon next to the magnifying glass to go to the chapters and jump to a specific one.Plato bottom menuThis is how the Plato menu looks like. Effectly, less options but still interesting, and it has some applications.Plato top menuIt has a calculator! , that’s amazing!.I didn’t expect a calculatorConclusionsBoth KOReader and Plato look very promising. I have the feeling that powerusers will prefer KOReader for its options and customizations, while people who only wants a better experience will be happy with Plato.Meanwhile, I will use both to decide and probably will use one or the other depending on what I am reading. For example, KOReader has some features to read manga3. I need to try those.  The script will install two component more, NickelMenu4 and KFMon5.Nickelmenu is the little menu I showed you, while KFMon allows us to launch specific commands when abook is opened.

    "content": "Due to the high number of obnoxious ads in modern internet, I decided to block as muchas I can at a DNS level using Pi-hole in my RPi.  DNS (Domain Name System) is the one that allow us to use www.google.com instead of142.251.41.68. Basically it translate domains names (like facebook.com) to IP address (like 31.13.80.36), so we don’t have to remember a bunch of numbers.Installing itIt is pretty easy actually. You only have to runcurl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bashAnd then, go through the questions in the terminal.  Running a random bash script from internet could be dangerous. Don’t do it if you don’t trustthe person (or group) that is providing it. In that case it is better to download it and verifyfirst before running it.In my case, I chose the default for everything and the Cloudflare servers as my upstream DNS.Post-InstallationChange the passwordDuring the installation, a new password for the web interface is showed. If you missed it, a newpassword can be generated running pihole -a -pNetworking settingsPi-hole can serve as DHCP, this is helpful to be sure all the hosts in the network are using Pi-hole as DNS. I wanted to enable it and set an static lease for my RPi and my modem/router.That can be done easily using the admin interface:  DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol that assigns IP address (and other networking settings like DNS) to hosts that are just connecting to a network. This way it is not required anymore to set manually such settings to connect a computer.  In left bar, click on Settings      On the top, click on the DHCP tab.          On DHCP Settings:                  DHCP server enabled is unchecked (it will be enabled in the last step)          Set the range, in my case from: 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.254 (this is the range of possible IP address that the DHCP can assign)          Set the gateway, in my case 192.168.2.1                            On Static DHCP leases configuration        I write the MAC address, the current IP address and as hostname “raspberry-pi” and click in the “plus” button to the right.        I did the same for my router, but hostname is “steve” (for some reason, that is how my ISP calls this model).                  Set and static IP to my raspberry pi. During the installation it was told that Pi-hole needs an static IP and a static lease in a DHCP will work, however as in my case Pi-hole is also the DHCP server, I need to set an static IP manually.          I set an static lease for my rpi in step 2.2 to be sure the DHCP server doesn’t assign the same IP to another host.        To do this, you only need to modify a file in /etc/network/interfaces.d/ in my case that file is eth0 and it ended looking like this:     auto eth0 iface eth0 inet static         address 192.168.2.20/24         gateway 192.168.2.1 iface eth0 inet6 auto        Pretty simple, an address and its netmask with its gateway. IPv6 is still handled automatically.    Enable the DHCP using the web interface.  Disable the DHCP on my router. (I can not give much details here as there is too many different routers/modem given by the ISP in different countries. But it should be somewhere around Network Settings )  The last step is to make sure the RPi is using the Pi-hole DNS. To do this, modify its/etc/resolv.conf file to something like this:    domain lansearch lannameserver 192.168.2.20              the lan in domain and search can be changed, you only to be sure it matchs the Pi-hole domain name setting, which you can modified in the Pi-hole DHCP settings.      Now everything is set, all the things connected to my network will use the Pi-hole as DNS and I will see a lot less ads as consequence.  You can add additional blocklists (or use another one) to Pi-hole: In the left, click on Adlist, now you can write the URL that has the blocklist and a comment, then click on Add.At the bottom you can enable or disable any blocklist. Finally, you need to update list of blocked domains, on the left, click on Tools, then click on Update Gravity and now click on the Update buttom.How it works:What Pi-hole does is to return an special IP address (0.0.0.0) 1 which mean this host on this network, thus making any request unroutable.Let’s see the difference:sequenceDiagramtitle Normal scenario    participant My Computer    participant ISP DNS    participant Internet    My Computer-&gt;&gt;ISP DNS: I want to visit facebook.com    ISP DNS-&gt;&gt;My Computer: facebook.com is 31.13.80.36    My Computer -&gt;&gt; Internet: Request to 31.13.80.36    Internet -&gt;&gt; My Computer: Here you goNow, that sequence would happen when you when the browser shows you an ad. It needsfirst the IP address of the server who has the ad to request it.But now Pi-hole will return an invalid address.sequenceDiagramtitle Pi-hole scenario    participant My Computer    participant Pi-hole    participant Internet    My Computer-&gt;&gt;Pi-hole: I want to visit trackingads.com    Pi-hole-&gt;&gt;My Computer: trackingads.com is \"0.0.0.0\"    My Computer -&gt;&gt; My Computer: Can not connect, nothing to showReal exampleIf I visit https://www.cnn.com/ I can see the following errors in Firefox:Errors in Firefox network monitorAnd we can verify those in the Pi-hole logsPi-hole logs            wikipedia &#8617;      "

    "content": "I started to use my raspberry pi 4 not long ago. As I use Debian the obvious choise was to flash the Raspberry Pi Debian image into the SD card.Now, as I’m planning connect it with a ethernet cable, I decided to disable the radio antennas.I tried to ways to achieve that.Disabling them using config.txtTo do that you only need to:  Create (or modify) /etc/default/raspi-firmware-custom with:    # Disable bluetooth and wifidtoverlay=disable-wifidtoverlay=disable-bt            Run update-initramfs -u -k all    This basically will update the /boot/firmware/config.txt with the above lines.    Remember that raspberry pi uses a config.txt file to modify the settings you would expect in the BIOS/UEFI in a normal PC.Now, after I restarted it, I noticed it didn’t work. Checking /etc/default/raspi-firmware I readMaybe not all options are supported..So, I proceed to disable the modules.Disabling the wifi/bt modules  Create this file /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf and add:     # Disable wifi blacklist brcmfmac blacklist brcmutil # Disable bluetooth blacklist hci_uart blacklist btbcm blacklist btintel blacklist rfcom blacklist btqca blacklist btsdio blacklist bluetooth        RestartThis time it worked! \\o/."

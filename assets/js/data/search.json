    "content": "The problem I noticed the linux native version of Surviving Mars has issues with my dual monitor setup. Basically it disables my vertical one but that is not all, it also has some glitches.  The objects seems to be “floating” and the shadows are not touching anything.     I discovered that using the windowed mode, my second monitor keeps working, but the glitches still.   I added some photos below.   Both monitors are working fine just before I start the game   My left monitor goes black and only the superior corner left of the other one shows something   Only my right monitor is working now  Now the glitches:   The installations and dome are floating   Even the rocks are in the air  I tried -w 1920 -h 1080 and didn’t work     Probably because those options are for valve/source games   Now if we try with proton, my dual monitor setup works as expected and there is not glitches   With proton it works flawless     I believe it works because wine can emulate a virtual desktop, but I still not understand 100% why it works.   I am going to show you what I did.  Idea I guessed the main issue was Surviving Mars seeing my two monitors just as one really big (that would explain that just the corner shows something while starting).  So I wanted to try gamescope https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope which is a microcompositor which allows me to set up custom resolution that the game would “see”.  Trying gamescope  Debian As I use Debian I tried first with the version in the apt repo, I ran: sudo aptitude install gamescope  I tried several times, nevertheless it didn’t work. I just assumed that it is because I ran steam with flatpak.  So I just removed the package and proceeded to install it using flatpak.  Flatpak  I ran flatpak install gamescope  and I chose runtime/org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.gamescope/x86_64/24.08.  Now gamescope finally works. Now I only need to find the correct setting.  Results  I tried several gamescope options and they help me with the glitches, but I couldn’t get to fix the issue with the second monitor going black.  Just gamescope -- %command% in the launch option was enough to fix the glitches.  I decided to start the game in windowed mode and voilà,  the game was running and my second monitor was showing discord.   No glitches and both monitors working  But even with a window maximized I can see the title bar and my other open programs in the botton bar and I don’t like to play that way. Thankfully it has a simple solution, I could simply click the window bar and choose  fullscreen and KDE will do the rest.   Location of the fullscreen option in KDE  However, doing that every time is silly. KDE allows you to define some rules to apply to windows and that exactly what I need.  Instead of just click fullscreen, click on Configure special application settings…  and a new window will appears.  Then click in add property… at the botton, look for Fullscreen, select Apply Initially and __Yes_. Finally __Apply_ and we are done.   Window rules options for Surviving Mars  Now I can play Surviving Mars in 1920x1080 fullscreen without any glitch and linux native.  I kept this option gamescope -H 1080 -b -- %command% just for consistency.   Now I can play in fullscreen without any issue  Final thoughts: I like to solve problems, but for any other person probably it would be better just to use proton. "

I bought this vaccum used a few years ago thus the lifespan I think it was normal.   The new battery I bought this one in Amazon1 (but you can find it cheapear in Aliexpress)  The new battery  The steps I did to do the replacement:          Make sure the vaccum’s switch is off.  Shutting down the vaccum           Remove all 6 small screws from the bottom. You are going to need the small screwdriver that came with the battery replacement.  Screws location           Remove the top. Be careful to not pull the cables.  How it looks inside           I disconnected these sensor cables to make easier the next steps.  These should be the IR cables           Remove the screws that keep the board attached to the vaccum.  There are 3 screws in this board           Lift a little bit the board to get access to the battery. Probably you are going to need to disconnect more cables.  You can see the original blue battery           Replace the battery and connect the battery. The batteries are keep in place by pression.  New battery in position           We are almost done, now you need to reconnect all the cables and put the screws into the board.  The board with the cables and screws           Put the external screws again.  It’s easier now           The robot vaccum is charging fine. Now the leed is blue.  Problem resolved      I tested a couple of times and it is working fine again.  The old battery This is the original battery in case you want to see the details.

It has a lot of options to customize the experience of using my Kobo, at first it could be overwhelming but I think it is worth it.  Now, I really missed it didn’t have a dictionary included. So let’s see  how to add one.  How to add a dictionary to KOReader     Find a dictionary in the StarDict format.   Copy the dictionary to .adds/koreader/data/dict/   I tried an english dictionary made from Wiktionary1.  After I decompress the file, it looks like this:  adds/koreader/data/dict/dict-en-en/    res/   dict-data.dict.dz   dict-data.idx   dict-data.ifo   dict-data.syn      As dictionaries can lives in different folders, I can keep adding them. For example, I can add an Spanish dictionary next.   Now we can see the dictionary running in KOReader.   The dictionary dialog  Download dictionaries in KOReader directly KOReader has a function to download dictionaries directly in the kobo.  These are the steps to do it:     Open the main menu.   Tap the magnifying glass.   Tap Settings, then Dictionary Settings   Tap Download dictionaries   Choose a language   Tap the title of a dictionary you want, then Download.   I chose the manual method because I like Wiktionary and it has a huge number of entries.  How to export highlights and notes  I use to highlight a lot while reading and I’m really glad to find that exporting those it is really easy in KOReader     Open your book.   Open the main menu and tap the wrench and screwdriver icon.   Then tap Exports all notes in this book   Find your notes in .adds/koreader/clipboard/      You can choose different formats like markdown for your notes and change the destination folder. Both options are in the same menu.      You can export highlights into your Calibre using the KOReader Sync plugin. But I did a quick test and the highlights aren’t ordered.                  ebook-reader-dict &#8617;&#xfe0e;          "

    "content": "Since a bought my Kobo Libra H2O, I have been thinking about tinker it a little bit installing a custom firmware and readers. And after a friend of mine convinced me, I finally decided to do it.  I am going to install KOReader1 and Plato2. Both are custom readers for Kobo (and other devices) with more features than the original.  I understand that KOReader has a lot of options while Plato is more streamline and it is better to read PDFs.  Getting the files  In this link, we find the instructions to install each of the readers (or both at the same time) as well as a little script to make everything easier.     Get the zip, in my case KOReader and Plato   Get the script.      The above links points to an specific version, in case they are broken. Review the forum thread and use the new links.   Installing the files     Do a full restart of the kobo, as it is suggested in the forum.   With the Kobo in the home screen (without opening any book), connect the kobo to the computer and mount it.   Run the script and follow the instructions.   Now, eject and unplug the kobo.      My Kobo restarted after I ejected it. Depending of your device, maybe you have to restart it manually.   During a the restart, Kobo will install the new readers and other things.  Result  Now I see a little new menu call NickelMenu at the botton right corner. That is the menu we are going to use to launch Plato and KOReader.   NickeMenu  KOReader  The first thing I saw, was the tutorial. I can navigate throught the files like a normal unix filesystem (the home is /mnt/onboard/) and it shows me folders with the name of the authors.   Books in KOReader  I opened The Prince and among the options I found a two columns setting.   Using the option of two columns  This is how the top menu looks like.  KOReader top menu  Really insteresting, and I just learned that there is a plugin for KOReader to enable SSH!.  I will review the other plugins.  Plato  Opening Plato for first time it didn’t offer any tutorial or guide, instead, a very intuitive  homescreen (really similar to the original one).   Books in Plato  I opened again The Prince to see the options. To the right I can tap in the icon next to the magnifying glass to go to the chapters and jump to a specific one.   Plato bottom menu  This is how the Plato menu looks like. Effectly, less options but still interesting, and it has some applications.   Plato top menu  It has a calculator! , that’s amazing!.   I didn’t expect a calculator  Conclusions  Both KOReader and Plato look very promising. I have the feeling that powerusers will prefer KOReader for its options and customizations, while people who only wants a better experience will be happy with Plato.  Meanwhile, I will use both to decide and probably will use one or the other depending on what I am reading. For example, KOReader has some features to read manga3. I need to try those.     The script will install two component more, NickelMenu4 and KFMon5. Nickelmenu is the little menu I showed you, while KFMon allows us to launch specific commands when a book is opened.

    "date": "2024-01-01 00:00:00 -0500",
    "content": "Due to the high number of obnoxious ads in modern internet, I decided to block as much as I can at a DNS level using Pi-hole in my RPi.     DNS (Domain Name System) is the one that allow us to use www.google.com instead of 142.251.41.68. Basically it translate domains names (like facebook.com) to IP address  (like 31.13.80.36), so we don’t have to remember a bunch of numbers.   Installing it  It is pretty easy actually. You only have to run curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash   And then, go through the questions in the terminal.     Running a random bash script from internet could be dangerous. Don’t do it if you don’t trust the person (or group) that is providing it. In that case it is better to download it and verify first before running it.   In my case, I chose the default for everything and the Cloudflare servers as my upstream DNS.  Post-Installation  Change the password During the installation, a new password for the web interface is showed. If you missed it, a new password can be generated running pihole -a -p  Networking settings  Pi-hole can serve as DHCP, this is helpful to be sure all the hosts in the network are using Pi-hole as DNS. I wanted to enable it and set an static lease for my RPi and my modem/router. That can be done easily using the admin interface:     DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol that assigns IP address (and other networking settings like DNS) to hosts that are just connecting to a network. This way it is not required anymore to set manually such settings to connect a computer.      In left bar, click on Settings        On the top, click on the DHCP tab.             On DHCP Settings:                    DHCP server enabled is unchecked (it will be enabled in the last step)           Set the range, in my case from: 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.254 (this is the range of possible IP address that the DHCP can assign)           Set the gateway, in my case 192.168.2.1                                On Static DHCP leases configuration          I write the MAC address, the current IP address and as hostname “raspberry-pi” and click in the “plus” button to the right.          I did the same for my router, but hostname is “steve” (for some reason, that is how my ISP calls this model).                       Set and static IP to my raspberry pi. During the installation it was told that Pi-hole needs an static IP and a static lease in a DHCP will work, however as in my case Pi-hole is also the DHCP server, I need to set an static IP manually.             I set an static lease for my rpi in step 2.2 to be sure the DHCP server doesn’t assign the same IP to another host.           To do this, you only need to modify a file in /etc/network/interfaces.d/ in my case that file is eth0 and it ended looking like this:      auto eth0  iface eth0 inet static          address 192.168.2.20/24          gateway 192.168.2.1  iface eth0 inet6 auto          Pretty simple, an address and its netmask with its gateway. IPv6 is still handled automatically.      Enable the DHCP using the web interface.   Disable the DHCP on my router. (I can not give much details here as there is too many different routers/modem given by the ISP in different countries. But it should be somewhere around Network Settings )   The last step is to make sure the RPi is using the Pi-hole DNS. To do this, modify its /etc/resolv.conf file to something like this:     domain lan search lan nameserver 192.168.2.20                  the lan in domain and search can be changed, you only to be sure it matchs the Pi-hole domain name setting, which you can modified in the Pi-hole DHCP settings.           Now everything is set, all the things connected to my network will use the Pi-hole as DNS and I will see a lot less ads as consequence.     You can add additional blocklists (or use another one) to Pi-hole: In the left, click on Adlist, now you can write the URL that has the blocklist and a comment, then click on Add. At the bottom you can enable or disable any blocklist.  Finally, you need to update list of blocked domains, on the left, click on Tools, then click on Update Gravity and now click on the Update buttom.   How it works:  What Pi-hole does is to return an special IP address (0.0.0.0) 1 which mean this host on this network, thus making any request unroutable.  Let’s see the difference:  sequenceDiagram title Normal scenario     participant My Computer     participant ISP DNS     participant Internet     My Computer-&gt;&gt;ISP DNS: I want to visit facebook.com     ISP DNS-&gt;&gt;My Computer: facebook.com is 31.13.80.36     My Computer -&gt;&gt; Internet: Request to 31.13.80.36     Internet -&gt;&gt; My Computer: Here you go   Now, that sequence would happen when you when the browser shows you an ad. It needs first the IP address of the server who has the ad to request it.  But now Pi-hole will return an invalid address.  sequenceDiagram title Pi-hole scenario     participant My Computer     participant Pi-hole     participant Internet     My Computer-&gt;&gt;Pi-hole: I want to visit trackingads.com     Pi-hole-&gt;&gt;My Computer: trackingads.com is \"0.0.0.0\"     My Computer -&gt;&gt; My Computer: Can not connect, nothing to show   Real example If I visit https://www.cnn.com/ I can see the following errors in Firefox:   Errors in Firefox network monitor  And we can verify those in the Pi-hole logs   Pi-hole logs                 wikipedia &#8617;&#xfe0e;          "

Now, as I’m planning connect it with a ethernet cable, I decided to disable the radio antennas. I tried to ways to achieve that.  Disabling them using config.txt To do that you only need to:     Create (or modify) /etc/default/raspi-firmware-custom with:     # Disable bluetooth and wifi dtoverlay=disable-wifi dtoverlay=disable-bt                Run update-initramfs -u -k all      This basically will update the /boot/firmware/config.txt with the above lines.         Remember that raspberry pi uses a config.txt file to modify the settings you would expect in the BIOS/UEFI in a normal PC.   Now, after I restarted it, I noticed it didn’t work. Checking /etc/default/raspi-firmware I read Maybe not all options are supported..  So, I proceed to disable the modules.  Disabling the wifi/bt modules    Create this file /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf and add:      # Disable wifi  blacklist brcmfmac  blacklist brcmutil   # Disable bluetooth  blacklist hci_uart  blacklist btbcm  blacklist btintel  blacklist rfcom  blacklist btqca  blacklist btsdio  blacklist bluetooth           Restart   This time it worked! \\o/.

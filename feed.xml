  <summary>Two weeks ago I noticed that M213S wasn’t charging correctly (the led was red and it was beeping awfuly loud), so I thought that maybe it was the battery.


  I bought this vaccum used a few years ago thus the lifespan I think it was normal.

  <summary>I have been playing with KOReader for some days and so far it is very good.
It has a lot of options to customize the experience of using my Kobo, at first it
could be overwhelming but I think it is worth it.

Now, I really missed it didn’t have a dictionary included. So let’s see 
how to add one.

  <summary>Since a bought my Kobo Libra H2O, I have been thinking about tinker it a little bit installing a
custom firmware and readers. And after a friend of mine convinced me, I finally decided to do it.

I am going to install KOReader1 and Plato2. Both are custom readers for Kobo (and other devices) with more features than the original.

I understand that KOReader has a lot of options while Plato is mo...</summary>

  <summary>Due to the high number of obnoxious ads in modern internet, I decided to block as much
as I can at a DNS level using Pi-hole in my RPi.


  DNS (Domain Name System) is the one that allow us to use www.google.com instead of
142.251.41.68. Basically it translate domains names (like facebook.com) to IP address 
(like 31.13.80.36), so we don’t have to remember a bunch of numbers.

  <summary>I started to use my raspberry pi 4 not long ago. As I use Debian the obvious choise 
was to flash the Raspberry Pi Debian image into the SD card.

Now, as I’m planning connect it with a ethernet cable, I decided to disable the radio antennas.
I tried to ways to achieve that.

Disabling them using config.txt
To do that you only need to:

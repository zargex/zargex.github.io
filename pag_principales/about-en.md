![yo]({{ site.url }}/images/aboutme.jpg)

I was born in Caracas, Venezuela {{ site.age }} years ago. Since I was a 
child, I have been interested by technology, specially electronics and computers.

I had the great fortune of studying Computer Engineering at USB, where I graduated in 2017.

I like the free software movement and its related topics. I started to use GNU/Linux in 2008, and it became my main OS in 2012.

About books, I like Sci-Fi (like Asimov's The Foundation saga) and fantasy (like The Lord of The Rings". And about videogames, my favorites are strategic genre (principally real time) and management in general.
